# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the CS373 Algorithms Course.

**Thoughts:** It's time to finally learn algorithms and data structures in depth.
I finished lecture 1 of the course. Followed up with a leetcode challenge, which was tough.
I encountered Rust while going through other developers' solutions and it felt very elegant.
Rust has been on my TO-DO list for a while now. All in all, I need to keep practicing.

### Day 2: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Proceeded with Lecture 2 of the CS373 course. Did some more Leetcode.

**Thoughts:**
The lecture had some useful info about using counter-examples to quickly disprove potential algorithms.
i.e. Try to find the smallest examples that can disprove a potential solution.
These examples can come in handy in places like unit tests.
There was an introduction to Big O and worst case complexity.

I reviewed the permutations code from yesterday, and learned that `n!` gives you the number of permutations of an `n`-digit input.
e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` will have `6` possible permutations.

I followed up with a leetcode challenge, related to optimizing an algorithm.
However, it was a topic I was familiar with and it was just a matter of adapting the solution to this question.
Keep pushing!

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
