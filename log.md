# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the CS373 Algorithms Course.

**Thoughts:** It's time to finally learn algorithms and data structures in depth.
I finished lecture 1 of the course. Followed up with a leetcode challenge, which was tough.
I encountered Rust while going through other developers' solutions and it felt very elegant.
Rust has been on my TO-DO list for a while now. All in all, I need to keep practicing.

**Link to work:**

- [Permutations Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

### Day 2: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Proceeded with Lecture 2 of the CS373 course. Did some more Leetcode.

**Thoughts:**
The lecture had some useful info about using counter-examples to quickly disprove potential algorithms.
i.e. Try to find the smallest examples that can disprove a potential solution.
These examples can come in handy in places like unit tests.
There was an introduction to Big O and worst case complexity.

I reviewed the permutations code from yesterday, and learned that `n!` gives you the number of permutations of an `n`-digit input.
e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` will have `6` possible permutations.

I followed up with a leetcode challenge, related to optimizing an algorithm.
However, it was a topic I was familiar with and it was just a matter of adapting the solution to this question.
Keep pushing!

**Link to work:** [Perfect Number Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-number/)

### Day 3: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 3 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but not enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about trying to analyze the worst case running time (Big O) of algorithms given their pseudocode.
We also got into logs, and I watched some more explanatory videos to refresh my knowledge on this topic.

I followed up with a couple of leetcode challenges, related to sorting and binary trees.
Nothing too challenging yet though.

- [Largest Number Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)
- [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

### Day 4: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 4 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but it didn't feel enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about the basic data structures e.g. Arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, linked lists, and queues.
It's getting more practical every day and I like this part more than the theoretical parts.

I was supposed to do a leetcode challenge, related to today's course content, but I chose to work on a challenge
I had failed in an interview just last month. It was a challenging one and it took me quite a while.

However, let's keep going. It feels like slow progress, but at the end of 100 days, it will be a lot of progress.

### Day 5: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't quite complete lecture 5.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired! I'll catch up tomorrow.
Didn't do any leetcode today. It was a crazy day, where I got involved in a road accident and the whole day
was pretty much wasted by that incident.

Trying to complete the lecture at 23:51 obviously does not help. I'll call it a day and pick up from there

I'm grateful to be alive!

- N/A

### Day 6: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed what was left of Lecture 5. Did some binary tree problems.

**Thoughts:**
The problems today were kinda tough, but I'm glad I stuck through them. BSTs look deceptively easy, until you try
to do an actual problem and realize that there's lots of edge cases. The concepts are mostly easy to grasp, but
implementing them requires a great deal of attention to detail. I guess some things you just learn through practice.

It felt like a productive day today!

- [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/94/trees/625/)

### Day 7: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 6 of Skiena's course, which introduced hashing and how it powers hash maps / dictionaries under the hood.

**Thoughts:**

For practice, I worked on a couple of problems requiring using a hashmap. It's been the most versatile data structure I've encountered yet

**Link to work:**

- [Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)
- [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

### Day 8: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 7 of the course, which was about sorting algorithms

**Thoughts:**

For practice, I worked on a problem that required using merge sort, which for this case was merging two sorted lists.
The trick: Construct a new dummy list, and create a reference to it, which you will manipulate.
At the end, just return the `next` node of the original list, which should have all the elements added.

**Link to work:**

- [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

### Day 9: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Skipped the lecture and instead watched the Udemy course, which went over the details
of the heap operations.

**Thoughts:**
I skipped the lecture, and focused on understanding heap operations in depth - insert, bubble up, extract min/max and bubble down.

It's easy to trip up on the implementation as there's lots of edge cases to watch out for.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 10: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Also skipped the lecture and and focused on practicing heaps and linked lists.

**Thoughts:**

I chose to focus on a problem involving heap / heap sort, and especially getting the bubble up / bubble down operations right.
It was categorized as `hard` so I feel really proud that I was able to solve it mostly by myself.
Things are looking up üòÄ

**Link to work:**

- [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

### Day 11: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 8 of the course, which was about divide and conquer algorithms - merge sort and quicksort

**Thoughts:**

The key to understand these divide and conquer algorithms is to understand recursion.

Quicksort - choosing a pivot, splitting up the list, and doing it again recursively on the split lists
Merge sort - splitting up the list into 2 every time, and calling merge sort again recursively on the split lists
Also needs the `merge` operation to merge the sorted lists.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 12: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have enough time to focus on any of the courses today. Solved one leetcode.

**Thoughts:**

A lot was going on and I missed yesterday - March 30th.
Anyway the best I could do today was a leetcode problem involving a variation of sorting - merging intervals.
It was nice to make some progress. It didn't feel like enough, but it was better than nothing

**Link to work:**

- [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

### Day 13: April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 9 of the course

**Thoughts:**

The course was about a breed of sorting algorithms that don't depend on comparison to sort the elements e.g. radix sort, which works well for sorting numbers

It works on the basis of splitting the inputs into buckets e.g. how you would sort a deck of cards

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 14: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 10 of the course, which introduced Graphs

**Thoughts:**
It's nice to finally go beyond sorting and grpahs look really interesting. I'm genuinely excited to learn about them.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 15: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Going to go deeper into graphs and how they are actually implemented in practice.

**Thoughts:**

Today is all about working out the finer details of working with graphs, and specifically adjacency lists.
I worked on adding & removing vertices and edges, and also learnt how to do depth-first search to traverse a graph.

**Link to work:**

- [Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

### Day 16: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I learnt about breadth first search, then tried to work on a leetcode problem. Didn't quite maange to figure it out,
and will take a look tomorrow with some fresh eyes.

**Thoughts:**

I worked through the videos a bit, then decided to do some practical problems.
Today's problem was really tough. I couldn't quite get a solution that worked for all the cases, and even the final
solution I came up with only worked on 16/80 cases. I really need to practice more since it seems the questions can
really blindside you. You think you've really understood a topic until you try to solve a leetcode problem.

**Link to work:**

- [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/) - *Incomplete*

### Day 17: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I finally cracked the Reconstruct Itinerary problem. I checked out some YT videos that explained the problem
really well and even covered the edge cases e.g. encountering a `source` with no `destination`, while the path
is not yet complete. The constantly failing test just forced me to really understand the problem, and I think
I'm better off üôèüèø

**Thoughts:**

I tried watching Skiena's lecture, but I just couldn't concentrate until I had resolved the Reconstruct Itinerary problem
on Leetcode

This was a blessing in disguise since I took the time to really understand the problem, and not just gloss over it.
It turns out my error was in the way I was constructing the graph, and not even related to the actual algorithm I
was trying to implement ü§∑

**Link to work:**

- [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

### Day 18: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I was able to complete Lecture 11 of the course, which was a more complete look at BFS, including cases where the graphs might
not be connected. It was worth waiting for a time when I could fully focus on it, as I did learn a lot.

**Thoughts:**

After trying to work through the leetcode problem, I really appreciate the usefulness of BFS. I still haven't cracked it
but I will get back to it tomorrow.
As a side effect, I finally learnt how to represent graphs using an adjacency matrix.

**Link to work:**

- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) - *Incomplete*

### Day 19: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I was able to complete Lecture 12 of the course, which delved deep into DFS, and how it can be used.
Luckily the professor talked about topological sort, which was the concept I needed to understand in order to solve
my in-progress leetcode problem, which was about detecting cycles in DAGs.

Even the professor himself said it would be a tough one to understand.

**Thoughts:**

Honestly, today was tough. I tried so many different approaches to the course scheduling problem, each one of them
failing harder than the previous ones üòÖ

I finally was able to solve it at the very end of the day, and the feeling of finally solving it after struggling with
it for so long is really amazing üåü

**Link to work:**

- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

### Day 20: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I completed lecture 13 of the course, which was finishing up on topological sort, and introducing minimum spanning trees.

**Thoughts:**

Honestly, today was also tough. I understood the minimum spanning trees just superficially,
and I'll need to go over some more resources to really get it.
On leetcode, I continued with part 2 of the Courses Scheduling problem, which was about returning
a valid ordering for the courses i.e. topological sort.
I opted to continue with the DFS approach I used last week on part 1, and the pseudocode on Wikipedia.
While I got stuck along the way, I finally solved it at the end of the day.

Finally cracking these challenges after a long struggle feels really good üòÄ

I feel like I'm getting better at it, and I'm now not really afraid of them.
I just know in advance that they will be challenging, and that's okay. It's an opportunity to learn.

### Day 21: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I only made it halfway through lecture 14 of the course, which was a deep dive into Kuskal's algorithm for finding
minimum spanning trees. It also introduced union-find algorithms.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I didn't do any leetcode problems.

However, I learnt about an actual graph database https://dgraph.io/ and I'll need to play with it some more.
I didn't find any leetcode covering the MST problem yet, so I guess that's why I wasn't too motivated.

Anyway I will try to at least learn some more about the union-find, which seems the most applicable part of
today's lecture.

Today felt like one of those slow progress days, but at least there was some progress.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 22: April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I completed the rest of lecture 14, which introduced shortest path algorithms, and specifically Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I also didn't do any leetcode problems, but I identified one that looks like a shortest path problem.
Haven't attempted it yet, though.

I also decided to set a kind of 'deadline' to apply for the job that's making me learn all of this stuff in the first place.
End of June seems like a nice time to try it out.
It should leave enough time to complete the course, and also like a full month of practice.

I also acknowledge that this probably needs to be a long term thing, and whether I get the job or not, it does seem
important to keep learning this stuff, or look for ways in which I can apply this knowledge, because without that,
it won't be too long before I have to learn everything from scratch again.
Processes > Goals.

I also think that setting a deadline might help a bit in giving me the motivation to go through with the rest of the course.
So end of June it is.

### Day 23: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I watched lecture 15, which was a continuation on shortest paths, for example in instances where you need to find the
shortest path from each node to every other node.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I was feeling very overwhelmed, especially from the sheer number of challenges on leetcode.
However, after finding out the actual numbers, I just accepted that I won't do all of them, but making one step
at a time is probably the best way to go.

I somehow found a problem I had seen elsewhere this week, and was surprised to find out that the solution required
a depth first search. These algorithms that I'm learning are really turning out to be useful, and it's nice to see
some progress, and some practical applications of this stuff.

It felt nice to solve the problem üòÄ

### Day 24: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I watched lecture 16, which introduced backtracking and covered a tiny bit of dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:**

Today I just had to really push through to complete the lecture, but I eventually did.
The content today was definitely interesting, showing how solving stuff like generating permutations, subsets and
sudoku problems work with backtracking.

I didn't do a practical problem, but I revisited the problem I worked on on day 1 (permutations),
and realized it's just a backtracking problem. The prof explained it really well, and now at least I get
the logic behind it. I didn't work on any code problem, but I felt like learning the concept was a step forward.

**Link to work:**

- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

### Day 25: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I watched lecture 17, which was still about backtracking and it's more advanced use cases e.g. N-queens problem

**Thoughts:**

I'm still trying to get the basic case and still trying to get how the permutations problem can be solved
using the backtracking technique.

I realized that the initial solution I had on leetcode is just not intuitive enough, and I just don't get it.
I've made some progress through watching some Youtube videos first, but still trying to push through and
"get" it

**Link to work:**

- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

### Day 26: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I watched lecture 18, which introduced dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:**

I've always struggled with dynamic programming and I hope this time I can finally get it.
The explanation today from the point of view of fibonacci numbers was intuitive and I think I got it.
Let's see how the rest goes.

About backtracking, I finally found a solution I can understand to the permutations problem.
It made it easy to follow the DFS tree and it will give me a point to refer to in the future.

It felt really good to finally get something that I can understand, and now I can move on to other problems,
and see whether the same approach works.

**Link to work:**

- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

### Day 27: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I watched lecture 19, which introduced dynamic programming to solve edit distance problems

**Thoughts:**

Learnt about some uses of Dynamic Programming e.g.  edit distance problems,
which I've encountered in many past interviews.

It seems the general steps to solving DP problems are:
- Figure out the recurrence relation
- Figure out the base case
- Solve for the intermediate states between the base case and your desired solution

I think I got the concept, but this topic has always been tough, so I'll need a lot of practice to make it stick

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 28: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I got halfway through lecture 20, which was still about edit distance problems.

**Thoughts:**

The edit distance algorithm can be modified to solve other variations
e.g. longest common sequence, # of characters to delete to form some string, etc.

I needed to do more practice and didn't really get to it. I'll need to fix this soon

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 29: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the rest of lecture 20.

**Thoughts:**

The benefit from watching more lectures is now diminishing. It's time to start practicing
dynamic programming questions.

I started on one edit distance problem and still trying to work through it, using the lecture notes
as a guide.

### Day 30: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

No lectures today. I decided to focus on doing some practical DP / edit distance problems.

**Thoughts:**

I finished up the Edit distance problem that was bugging me since Friday, and also ended up doing another
related problem i.e. Longest Common Subsequence

It felt really good solving these problems, and I'm looking forward to solving more.
Dynamic programming has kicked my ass for long enough üòÖ

### Day 31: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with Lecture 21, which went over more examples of dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:**

It seems this is a really tough / important topic, because the prof has spent quite a lot of time on it.
Anyway I was able to follow today's examples, so I'm also starting to get the hang of it.

**Link to work:**

- Reviewed past DP Interview Question

### Day 32: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Completed Lecture 22, which was about even more examples of dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:**

Today's examples were a bit more complicated, and I'm not sure I would encounter them in an interview.

I also started watching the complementary dynamic programming course, and I like how it starts from the
ground up, and even explain *why* & *how* dynamic programming is better than recursion.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 33: April 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Skipped Skiena's lectures today, and watched the [dynamic programming YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlT4HG93Gaw&list=PLVrpF4r7WIhTT1hJqZmjP10nxsmrbRvlf) instead

**Thoughts:**

The course explained the dynamic programming concepts really well, and even provided a framework with which
to evaluate dynamic programming problems.

It really helped a lot, since I was able to solve the unique paths problem all by myself.
To be fair, it was very similar to the stair case problem, that was explained in the course contents.

I'll reproduce the framework here, with the values for the unique paths problem, since it was so helpful:

1. Objective function
>  - F(m, n) => # of ways to go from (0,0) to (m, n)
> - Can only move right(0,1) or down(1,0)
2. Base cases
> - F(0, 0) = 1
> - F(0, 1) = 1 -> For the whole of the first row, the answer will be 1 (Only 1 way to go: Right)
> - F(1, 0) = 1 -> For the whole of the first column, the answer will be 1 (Only 1 way to go: Down)
> - F(1, 1) = 2 -> sum of the previous two

3. Recurrence relation
> - F(m, n) = F(m-1, n) + F(n-1, m)

4. Order of execution
> - bottom up

5. Where to look for answer
> - Solution will be in bottom right -> matrix[m-1][n-1]

This framework also made it easy to solve the variation of the problem i.e. unique paths with obstacle

*Postscript:* <br/>
1/3 of the way done, and I've come such a long way from where I started. I really appreciate the decision I made
to get started on this series. It's been tough, but I've discovered that I'm capable of so much, and I've got to
keep going and learn as much as I can.

### Day 34: April 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Watched a couple more lectures from the [dynamic programming YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlT4HG93Gaw&list=PLVrpF4r7WIhTT1hJqZmjP10nxsmrbRvlf) and I just like it better.

It's making this whole topic very understandable.

**Thoughts:**

It also seems that by starting from Skiena's course, I learnt most of this stuff backwards.
I should have started with the easy cases, like the ones here, and then built up this knowledge from there on.

Starting from the more complicated ones just makes this topic look harder than it might actually be.

### Day 35: May 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the original algorithms course, and started learning about NP-completeness

Watched one more lecture from the [dynamic programming YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlT4HG93Gaw&list=PLVrpF4r7WIhTT1hJqZmjP10nxsmrbRvlf) and I still like it better.

### Day 36: May 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the original algorithms course, and continued learning about NP-completeness.
However, at this point I've got the maximum value from the course, and I'll stop there.

I can always revisit these topics later, when I actually need them.

**Thoughts:**

Really struggled to complete Skiena's lecture, again. I think it's way too theoretical, and not
too relevant for what I'm preparing for.
It's been really helpful, and I'm confident the bulk of what I need to know has already been covered in the
lectures I've watched.

Still going to go through with the [dynamic programming YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlT4HG93Gaw&list=PLVrpF4r7WIhTT1hJqZmjP10nxsmrbRvlf) as I still have a lot to learn on that topic.

### Day 37: May 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the Dynamic Programming course, and watched lectures on Top Down vs Bottom up solutions
for DP Problems. Today we also went through the coin change problem

**Thoughts:**

Still trying to keep up with dynamic programming, and today I think I got the concept behind
the coin change problem.

However, when attempting it on leetcode, it was a bit trickier than I thought, and my solution was too slow.
I had mostly borrowed it, but I understood what was going on, and I'll just proceed to optimize it next time.

### Day 38: May 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the Dynamic Programming course, and watched lectures on variations of the coin change problem

**Thoughts:**

I found it really hard to concentrate, but somehow I finally managed to solve the coin change problem,
thanks to this [awesome video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9bfqozjoqs)

I realized that I was stuck with the top down approach (recursion + memoization), which is harder anyway.
However, I found that it's necessary to start there so as to be able to figure out the DP solution.

It felt really awesome to finally crack it, and I feel really good about such problems going forward.
For DP, it now feels like I have to practice with the string problems, and the more tricky ones e.g. frog jump

However, I'm very happy with my progress so far ‚òÄÔ∏è

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the Dynamic Programming course, and watched more lectures on variations of the coin change problem

**Thoughts:**

I noticed that just watching videos with no concrete aim doesn't quite work for me,

### Day 40: May 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Watched one more video from the DP course, on how to use dynamic programming to find the
shortest path in a graph

**Thoughts:**

Decided to focus on interview questions that have appeared before in the company I'm targeting.
At least this should give me exposure to a few more topics that I might be rusty in.

I struggled on a backtracking problem, and I'll get back to it and make sure I get it.

### Day 41: May 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with trying to solve the backtracking problem from yesterday

**Thoughts:**

I came up with a different approach, backtracking + pruning, but it's still timing out on large inputs ‚è≥
I've exhausted my own ideas, and next I'll start exploring how others have solved the problem, and learn from them.

I've identified a few videos on the topic, and I'll try to really understand it tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**:

Finally solved the backtracking problem that I've been battling the last 2 days

**Thoughts:**

The solution I found was way simpler and faster than what I was doing before.
Just shows that the simplicity is the end result of a lot of hard work, not the beginning.

I explored a couple more questions after this, but didn't really attempt them.

### Day 44: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Worked on 2 more leetcode questions, refreshing my knowledge on tries and binary trees.

**Thoughts:**

I had assumed I had mastered tries, but I quickly learnt I forgot almost everything.
I had solved a trie problem on Hackerrank a while back, and I pretty much relied on that to get through this one.

### Day 45: May 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Taking a break from the leetcode questions, and moving on to some practical stuff, with Elixir.

**Thoughts:**

I'll be exploring practical stuff like, where are queues / trees used in practice?
To make it interesting I'll be using Elixir which I've always wanted to learn in depth.
Just today, I checked out topological sort and how it's used in mix, the package manager.
However, I'll come back to this later on.

### Day 46: May 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Started exploring Elixir once again, and it felt so nice. This is the language that just works for me.

**Thoughts:**

Today was just a crash course in the syntax and semantics.
It felt really good re-learning this and figuring out some stuff that's just so elegant in Elixir

Just look at this to generate permutations:

```elixir
def permute([]), do: [[]]
def permute(lst) do
  for head <- lst, rest <- permute(lst -- [head]), do: [head | rest]
end
```

### Day 47: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued exploring Elixir, and learned more about processes, and how to manage state & concurrent operations.
It's amazing because most languages don't have these concepts inbuilt.

**Thoughts:**

Followed up on a few more things - processes, Enum/List operations, and IO operations.
I'm also just realizing how intuitive this is becoming after working with Ruby at work for the past year.
I'm also realizing how to better write the software I was writing before with Elixir e.g. The torrent client

### Day 48: May 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued exploring Elixir, and learned more about IO and working with files.
Also kept going with 30 days of Elixir, and learned some more about maps.

**Thoughts:**

Turns out opening and writing to files in Elixir all works in processes. Didn't know that.

It seems I'll just keep posting these updates here as there's just less pressure üôÇ
Let me keep off Twitter for a while. However, it has been extremely useful in knowing how to summarize stuff.

### Day 49: May 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Covered Structs in Elixir. Created the blog.

**Thoughts:**

I created the blog and even started writing the first post - 0 to 100 with Elixir.
Maybe this is something I can write as I go, rather than a one-off.

Maybe I should just get to the point - Cooking up the first algorithm - Topological sort.

### Day 50: May 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Not too sure I'll keep going with Elixir. But we'll see.
Today I was exploring crypto, and specifically how AMM work, and the associated risks.

**Thoughts:**

A lucky event over the weekend triggered my interest in crypto once again.
Today I was mostly researching and trying to figure out how automated market making works.
Specficially, I was looking at the math of providing liquidity vs holding tokens.

I'm very convinced that crypto is here to stay, and even better, it combines 2 of my interests - code and finance.
I'll see if I'll keep going in this direction.

However, it seems exploring niche languages might not be necessary. Maybe I should be working more with the
languages I'm already using at work. There's a lot of room for improvement there, even if I use them daily.

### Day 51: May 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Didn't do much today. Checked out 30 days of Elixir and learnt about records and structs

**Thoughts:**

Still spent some time exploring Crypto / DeFi and also checked out Elixir records, which are totally new for me.

### Day 52: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I think it's now clear that I won't be giving much attention to just algorithms for interviews going forward.
However, what would happen if I dedicated this time to really learn about crypto?? I guess we'll find out.

**Thoughts:**

I'll dedicate the latter half of this challenge to crypto.
The crypto / DeFi world seems to have a lot of opportunities, and really all that's required is to show up.
Better still, there's some algorithms knowledge required there.

Today I set up a wallet on the Binance Smart Chain, and was able to transfer some BNB from Binance to the wallet.
I was also able to setup yield farming with these tokens. The rates here are much higher than in the Binance liquidity pools,
so I'll compare after a month or so and see the progress.

### Day 53: May 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued learning about crypto, and read the basics of ERC-20 tokens.
Turns out the spec is very short and clear, and it seems really straightforward to create one.
Maybe I should actually create one to practice ü§î

**Thoughts:**

I also started going through a [Blockchain and Money course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn&index=1) and I'm genuinely excited for this.
Maybe it's because I'm just doing it to fulfill my curiosity, and not with a shallow goal in mind, like impressing
some recruiters.

Anyway I'll keep going in this direction and see where it leads me.

There's not that many people in this space, while the demand is almost certain to grow.
I just need to be on the right side of that equation, having the skills in demand that there's not too much competition for

### Day 54: May 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued learning about crypto, and learnt about auto-compouding liquidity pools.

**Thoughts:**

These liquidity pools automatically plow back the earnings into the selected pool e.g. CAKE-BNB on Pancakeswap.
Ideally, this is what you would do manually, but they just automate it for you, automatically increasing the rates.

So the units keep increasing, without adding any new funds.
When the prices are dropping, it's even better since the price per additional unit decreases.
A good example is beefy.finance.

This is exacly what you want to be happening and the fact that I can get access to such platforms is crazy.

Let's see how long this can last

### Day 55: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the Blockchain and Money course, and watched lecture 2.

**Thoughts:**

I'm loving the course.

It seems like the kind of content I should have learnt back when I was studying economics.
I also love that it's very practical, and I'm just excited to learn the basics.

### Day 56: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Watched part of the Blockchain and Money course, lecture 3.
I also read the Bitcoin paper for the first time, and explored some resources on how blockchains work.

**Thoughts:**

I'm still loving the course.

The paper was part of the required readings, and I'm very glad the course made me read it.
I got at least part of it, and I'm loving the technical bits - the hashing, merkle trees, and related stuff.

This feels very strongly like what I should be focusing on day to day. The blockchain is a valuable skill to learn,
and it's definitely niche enough to maybe command a good salary.

The primary way I hope to learn practically is by exploring the projects I already use, since most of them are open source.

### Day 57: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with Lecture 3 of Blockchain and Money course.

**Thoughts:**

The lecture was about the technical details of bitcoin, and other blockchains in general.
i.e. how it works under the hood - hash functions, how nodes work, contents of a block header, etc.

I also started checking out the code for one of the projects I already use for yield farming, and it's in React.
I'll continue exploring that side too, to learn the practical aspects.

### Day 58: June 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Finally finished Lecture 3 of the Blockchain and Money course.

**Thoughts:**

I learnt about how public key cryptography is used in bitcoin, and also explored how it's used generally.
Also explored Merkle trees and how they are used to compress / store the transaction data.

Learned that public key cryptography was created to solve a problem where 2 people need to share some sensitive info,
without needing to have the same key / password.

### Day 59: June 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Started watching a practical course on YouTube on how to create a decentralized app.
I started following along and it seems the tooling has really come a long way.

**Thoughts:**

Turns out there's very good libraries out there that make working with smart contracts easier.
There's Truffle and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), which make interacting with the
smart contracts and testing much easier.

I like this way of doing things and I'll keep following along the course

### Day 60: June 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Took a break there where I was more interested in researching stocks and reading annual reports.

Continued with the MIT Blockchain course, and completed lecture 4.

**Thoughts:**

The remaining part of the lecture was all about proof of work and how it works on the bitcoin blockchain.
i.e. the dificulty (leading zeros) and how often it's changed, the reward mechanism (through coinbase transactions),
the various roles e.g. miners and mining pools.

It was a very interesting lecture overall.

### Day 61: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued with the MIT Blockchain course, and started lecture 5.

**Thoughts:**

It was all about how transactions work on bitcoin, including how balances are maintained.
e.g. Any balance left over from a transaction is also sent to your own address.
There's also the fact that the coinbase transaction (reward to miners for solving proof of work) is
usually included as the first transaction in the merkle tree.

Also, balances don't really exist, and the money you can send is really an output from a previous transaction.
