# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the CS373 Algorithms Course.

**Thoughts:** It's time to finally learn algorithms and data structures in depth.
I finished lecture 1 of the course. Followed up with a leetcode challenge, which was tough.
I encountered Rust while going through other developers' solutions and it felt very elegant.
Rust has been on my TO-DO list for a while now. All in all, I need to keep practicing.

### Day 2: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Proceeded with Lecture 2 of the CS373 course. Did some more Leetcode.

**Thoughts:**
The lecture had some useful info about using counter-examples to quickly disprove potential algorithms.
i.e. Try to find the smallest examples that can disprove a potential solution.
These examples can come in handy in places like unit tests.
There was an introduction to Big O and worst case complexity.

I reviewed the permutations code from yesterday, and learned that `n!` gives you the number of permutations of an `n`-digit input.
e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` will have `6` possible permutations.

I followed up with a leetcode challenge, related to optimizing an algorithm.
However, it was a topic I was familiar with and it was just a matter of adapting the solution to this question.
Keep pushing!

### Day 3: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 3 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but not enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about trying to analyze the worst case running time (Big O) of algorithms given their pseudocode.
We also got into logs, and I watched some more explanatory videos to refresh my knowledge on this topic.

I followed up with a couple of leetcode challenges, related to sorting and binary trees.
Nothing too challenging yet though.

### Day 4: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 4 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but it didn't feel enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about the basic data structures e.g. Arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, linked lists, and queues.
It's getting more practical every day and I like this part more than the theoretical parts.

I was supposed to do a leetcode challenge, related to today's course content, but I chose to work on a challenge
I had failed in an interview just last month. It was a challenging one and it took me quite a while.

However, let's keep going. It feels like slow progress, but at the end of 100 days, it will be a lot of progress.

### Day 5: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't quite complete lecture 5.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired! I'll catch up tomorrow.
Didn't do any leetcode today. It was a crazy day, where I got involved in a road accident and the whole day
was pretty much wasted by that incident.

Trying to complete the lecture at 23:51 obviously does not help. I'll call it a day and pick up from there

I'm grateful to be alive!

### Day 6: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed what was left of Lecture 5. Did some binary tree problems.

**Thoughts:**
The problems today were kinda tough, but I'm glad I stuck through them. BSTs look deceptively easy, until you try
to do an actual problem and realize that there's lots of edge cases. The concepts are mostly easy to grasp, but
implementing them requires a great deal of attention to detail. I guess some things you just learn through practice.

It felt like a productive day today!
