# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the CS373 Algorithms Course.

**Thoughts:** It's time to finally learn algorithms and data structures in depth.
I finished lecture 1 of the course. Followed up with a leetcode challenge, which was tough.
I encountered Rust while going through other developers' solutions and it felt very elegant.
Rust has been on my TO-DO list for a while now. All in all, I need to keep practicing.

### Day 2: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Proceeded with Lecture 2 of the CS373 course. Did some more Leetcode.

**Thoughts:**
The lecture had some useful info about using counter-examples to quickly disprove potential algorithms.
i.e. Try to find the smallest examples that can disprove a potential solution.
These examples can come in handy in places like unit tests.
There was an introduction to Big O and worst case complexity.

I reviewed the permutations code from yesterday, and learned that `n!` gives you the number of permutations of an `n`-digit input.
e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` will have `6` possible permutations.

I followed up with a leetcode challenge, related to optimizing an algorithm.
However, it was a topic I was familiar with and it was just a matter of adapting the solution to this question.
Keep pushing!

### Day 3: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 3 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but not enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about trying to analyze the worst case running time (Big O) of algorithms given their pseudocode.
We also got into logs, and I watched some more explanatory videos to refresh my knowledge on this topic.

I followed up with a couple of leetcode challenges, related to sorting and binary trees.
Nothing too challenging yet though.

- [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

### Day 4: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lecture 4 of the course. Did some more Leetcode, but it didn't feel enough.

**Thoughts:**
Today's lecture was about the basic data structures e.g. Arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, linked lists, and queues.
It's getting more practical every day and I like this part more than the theoretical parts.

I was supposed to do a leetcode challenge, related to today's course content, but I chose to work on a challenge
I had failed in an interview just last month. It was a challenging one and it took me quite a while.

However, let's keep going. It feels like slow progress, but at the end of 100 days, it will be a lot of progress.

### Day 5: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't quite complete lecture 5.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired! I'll catch up tomorrow.
Didn't do any leetcode today. It was a crazy day, where I got involved in a road accident and the whole day
was pretty much wasted by that incident.

Trying to complete the lecture at 23:51 obviously does not help. I'll call it a day and pick up from there

I'm grateful to be alive!

### Day 6: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed what was left of Lecture 5. Did some binary tree problems.

**Thoughts:**
The problems today were kinda tough, but I'm glad I stuck through them. BSTs look deceptively easy, until you try
to do an actual problem and realize that there's lots of edge cases. The concepts are mostly easy to grasp, but
implementing them requires a great deal of attention to detail. I guess some things you just learn through practice.

It felt like a productive day today!

### Day 7: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 6 of Skiena's course, which introduced hashing and how it powers hash maps / dictionaries under the hood.

**Thoughts:**

For practice, I worked on a couple of problems requiring using a hashmap. It's been the most versatile data structure I've encountered yet

- [Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)
- [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

### Day 8: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 7 of the course, which was about sorting algorithms

**Thoughts:**

For practice, I worked on a problem that required using merge sort, which for this case was merging two sorted lists.
The trick: Construct a new dummy list, and create a reference to it, which you will manipulate.
At the end, just return the `next` node of the original list, which should have all the elements added.

### Day 9: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Skipped the lecture and instead watched the Udemy course, which went over the details
of the heap operations.

**Thoughts:**
I skipped the lecture, and focused on understanding heap operations in depth - insert, bubble up, extract min/max and bubble down.

It's easy to trip up on the implementation as there's lots of edge cases to watch out for.

### Day 10: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Also skipped the lecture and and focused on practicing heaps and linked lists.

**Thoughts:**

I chose to focus on a problem involving heap / heap sort, and especially getting the bubble up / bubble down operations right.
It was categorized as `hard` so I feel really proud that I was able to solve it mostly by myself.
Things are looking up üòÄ

### Day 11: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 8 of the course, which was about divide and conquer algorithms - merge sort and quicksort

**Thoughts:**

The key to understand these divide and conquer algorithms is to understand recursion.

Quicksort - choosing a pivot, splitting up the list, and doing it again recursively on the split lists
Merge sort - splitting up the list into 2 every time, and calling merge sort again recursively on the split lists
Also needs the `merge` operation to merge the sorted lists.

### Day 12: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have enough time to focus on any of the courses today. Solved one leetcode.

**Thoughts:**

A lot was going on and I missed yesterday - March 30th.
Anyway the best I could do today was a leetcode problem involving a variation of sorting - merging intervals.
It was nice to make some progress. It didn't feel like enough, but it was better than nothing

**Link to work:**

- [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

### Day 13: April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 9 of the course

**Thoughts:**

The course was about a breed of sorting algorithms that don't depend on comparison to sort the elements e.g. radix sort, which works well for sorting numbers

It works on the basis of splitting the inputs into buckets e.g. how you would sort a deck of cards

### Day 14: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed lecture 10 of the course, which introduced Graphs

**Thoughts:**
It's nice to finally go beyond sorting and grpahs look really interesting. I'm genuinely excited to learn about them.

**Link to work:**

- N/A

### Day 15: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Going to go deeper into graphs and how they are actually implemented in practice.

**Thoughts:**

Today is all about working out the finer details of working with graphs, and specifically adjacency lists.
I worked on adding & removing vertices and edges, and also learnt how to do depth-first search to traverse a graph.

### Day 16: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I learnt about breadth first search, then tried to work on a leetcode problem. Didn't quite maange to figure it out,
and will take a look tomorrow with some fresh eyes.

**Thoughts:**

I worked through the videos a bit, then decided to do some practical problems.
Today's problem was really tough. I couldn't quite get a solution that worked for all the cases, and even the final
solution I came up with only worked on 16/80 cases. I really need to practice more since it seems the questions can
really blindside you. You think you've really understood a topic until you try to solve a leetcode problem.

- [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/) - *Incomplete*

### Day 17: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I finally cracked the Reconstruct Itinerary problem. I checked out some YT videos that explained the problem
really well and even covered the edge cases e.g. encountering a `source` with no `destination`, while the path
is not yet complete. The constantly failing test just forced me to really understand the problem, and I think
I'm better off üôèüèø

**Thoughts:**

I tried watching Skiena's lecture, but I just couldn't concentrate until I had resolved the Reconstruct Itinerary problem
on Leetcode

This was a blessing in disguise since I took the time to really understand the problem, and not just gloss over it.
It turns out my error was in the way I was constructing the graph, and not even related to the actual algorithm I
was trying to implement ü§∑

### Day 18: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I was able to complete Lecture 11 of the course, which was a more complete look at BFS, including cases where the graphs might
not be connected. It was worth waiting for a time when I could fully focus on it, as I did learn a lot.

**Thoughts:**

After trying to work through the leetcode problem, I really appreciate the usefulness of BFS. I still haven't cracked it
but I will get back to it tomorrow.
As a side effect, I finally learnt how to represent graphs using an adjacency matrix.

- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) - *Incomplete*

### Day 19: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I was able to complete Lecture 12 of the course, which delved deep into DFS, and how it can be used.
Luckily the professor talked about topological sort, which was the concept I needed to understand in order to solve
my in-progress leetcode problem, which was about detecting cycles in DAGs.

Even the professor himself said it would be a tough one to understand.

**Thoughts:**

Honestly, today was tough. I tried so many different approaches to the course scheduling problem, each one of them
failing harder than the previous ones üòÖ

I finally was able to solve it at the very end of the day, and the feeling of finally solving it after struggling with
it for so long is really amazing üåü

### Day 20: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I completed lecture 13 of the course, which was finishing up on topological sort, and introducing minimum spanning trees.

**Thoughts:**

Honestly, today was also tough. I understood the minimum spanning trees just superficially,
and I'll need to go over some more resources to really get it.
On leetcode, I continued with part 2 of the Courses Scheduling problem, which was about returning
a valid ordering for the courses i.e. topological sort.
I opted to continue with the DFS approach I used last week on part 1, and the pseudocode on Wikipedia.
While I got stuck along the way, I finally solved it at the end of the day.

Finally cracking these challenges after a long struggle feels really good üòÄ

I feel like I'm getting better at it, and I'm now not really afraid of them.
I just know in advance that they will be challenging, and that's okay. It's an opportunity to learn.

### Day 21: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I only made it halfway through lecture 14 of the course, which was a deep dive into Kuskal's algorithm for finding
minimum spanning trees. It also introduced union-find algorithms.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I didn't do any leetcode problems.

However, I learnt about an actual graph database https://dgraph.io/ and I'll need to play with it some more.
I didn't find any leetcode covering the MST problem yet, so I guess that's why I wasn't too motivated.

Anyway I will try to at least learn some more about the union-find, which seems the most applicable part of
today's lecture.

Today felt like one of those slow progress days, but at least there was some progress.
